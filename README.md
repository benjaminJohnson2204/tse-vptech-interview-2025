# Classes Voter

Your task is to build a web application where users can vote on their favorite CSE class at UCSD. Every user who votes will enter their username and choose their favorite class. There is no need to log in before voting.

Everyone's votes should be displayed in a list, each one displaying the username and that user's favorite class.

Here's a screenshot of the empty state (no votes cast yet):

And a screenshot after some votes have been cast:
